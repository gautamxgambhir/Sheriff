## What is it?

Road accidents, A very common problem, but still nobody is using Al technology to solve it,
so I decided to make a program to solve it, Sheriff - An Al enabled program to detect car speed and to prevent road accidents, 
it will detect which car is overspeeding the speed limit and we can fine some charge to the driver, 
if the car is overspeeding, with Sheriff we can check which car was in overspeed or underspeed by checking the report.log file generated by the program, 
and it will also save the images of cars which were in overspeed, in a folder, to detect the speed, 
you have to select the video file and then it will start doing the process.

## Main Features

Here are just a few of the things that Sheriff does well:

 - Detect car speed using **speed=distance/time** formula.
 - You can detect car speed from any video file.
 - UI made with [PyQt5](https://www.qt.io/).

 ` We know these features are not enough to make a change, but we are trying to improve Sheriff, and hopefully we will reach our goal soon`

[Video Tutorial for Sheriff Usage](https://streamable.com/29yprj)

**Enter the speed Limit**
- Enter the *Speed Limit* in the input box you want to set

**Click On Start Button**
 - Click on *Start* Button and select the video file

    Now Sheriff should Start detecting car speed from the provided video
    Do the following steps when the detection is complete
    If you are facing any errors feel free to contact me.

**Navigate to overspeeding directory**
 - Navigate to *Overspeeding* directory to see the report

**Navigate to overspeeding/cars directory**
 - Navigate to cars directory located in overspeeding directory to see the *images of cars* which were overspeeding
